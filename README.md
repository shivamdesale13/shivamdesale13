### Heyy there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shivam, a Master's in Computer Science student at San Diego State University, driven by a passion for building scalable, efficient, and impactful solutions.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently enhancing my skills in Web Development and Cloud Computing.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning advanced frameworks like React, Django, and exploring DevOps tools such as Docker and Kubernetes.
ðŸ’¡ I enjoy solving complex problems, especially in areas like backend optimization and scalable system design.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those involving machine learning, data visualization, or web applications.

âš¡ Fun fact: I once reduced operational costs by 30% and improved data retrieval speeds by 50% through innovative AWS integrations in a healthcare project!
